    find_longest_common_prefix returns the longest string common at the start of any two strings in the passed list.

    In the event that an empty list, a list containing one string, or a list of strings with no common prefixes is passed, the empty string will be returned.

     Before: O(n² × L) — compares every pair of strings (n² pairs), each comparison
    up to O(L) where L is string length. With 1,000,000 strings this never completes.

    After: O(n log n × L) — sort the strings once (O(n log n × L)), then compare
    only adjacent pairs (O(n × L)). Sorting brings strings with common prefixes
    together: the longest common prefix between any two strings in the list is
    always found between adjacent strings in sorted order.
